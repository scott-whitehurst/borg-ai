# borg-ai

Functionality based on input:

None:
Echo the user's name when invoked, list the available functions

Time:
When time is given as a parameter, provide two strings referring to the time of day and whether the user should be on/off the job

Dice:
Very basic diceroll to echo number from 1 to 6

Recycle:
Based on user input, move a file to the trash directory (reporting error if file not found) - consider configuring a cron job to empty this at the start of every month

Game:
Play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user - there is probably a simpler way to code this, but for now it seems to give fair odds
